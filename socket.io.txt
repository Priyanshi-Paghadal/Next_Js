Socket.IO is a popular library used for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. It is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, live notifications, or collaborative tools.

Socket.IO Middleware
Middleware functions can be used to handle events before they reach the main logic. This is useful for things like authentication, logging, etc.

io.use((socket, next) => {
  if (socket.handshake.query.token === 'valid-token') {
    next();
  } else {
    next(new Error('Authentication error'));
  }
});

Rooms
Room Concept: Rooms allow you to group sockets together. A socket can join or leave a room. This is useful for creating chat rooms, game lobbies, or private channels.

// Server-side: Joining a room
socket.join('room1');

// Server-side: Emitting to a specific room
io.to('room1').emit('message', 'Hello room 1!');

// Client-side: Joining a room
socket.emit('joinRoom', 'room1');

Socket.IO allows you to send a callback function as an argument to emit events, creating two-way communication.

socket.emit('event', data, (response) => {
  console.log(response); // Handling the server's response
});
