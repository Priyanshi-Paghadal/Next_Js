Server : - A server is a computer or a program that provides services or resources to other computers, called clients, over a network.

The server is like a waiter who brings you food (services or data).
The client is you, making a request (ordering food).

Servers often interact with databases to fetch or save data and send it to the client.

database : -A database is an organized collection of information (data) that is stored electronically so it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Your phone's contact list is like a small database. It stores names, phone numbers, and other details in an organized way.

Databases rely on servers to communicate with clients and process queries.

server :- Handles requests, processes data, and sends responses (e.g., hosting websites, running applications).

database :- Stores, organizes, and manages data for easy access and retrieval.

A server is like a waiter in a restaurant who takes your order, fetches the food, and serves it to you.
A database is like the kitchen where the food (data) is prepared and stored.

Backend :- The backend refers to the part of a software application that operates behind the scenes. It is responsible for the logic, database interactions, and server operations that enable the app to function properly.

When you browse products or place an order, the backend handles tasks like fetching product details, processing your order, and updating the database.

If the app is like a restaurant:
The frontend is the menu and the dining area (what customers see and interact with).
The backend is the kitchen, where the orders are processed and the food is prepared.

API :- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows two software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a middleman, enabling different systems to exchange data or perform tasks without knowing the details of each other's implementation.

You (the client) tell the waiter (API) your order.
The waiter communicates with the kitchen (backend/server) to prepare your food (data).
The waiter brings the food (response) back to you.

Weather App: Uses an API to fetch weather data from a weather service.
Login with Google/Facebook: These use APIs to authenticate users.
Online Shopping: Payment gateways (like PayPal or Stripe) use APIs to process transactions.

API key : -
An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a client (user, app, or system) making requests to an API. It ensures that only authorized clients can access the API and its resources.

Authentication: Verifies that the client is allowed to use the API.
Usage Tracking: Tracks how often the API is being used and by whom.
Access Control: Limits access to specific features or data based on the client.
Security: Protects APIs from unauthorized access or abuse

Part of API Key : -

 Client/Project Identifier:
Identifies the user, application, or project making the request.
Ensures the API provider knows who is using their service.
Example: "12345-ABCDE"

 Secret Key:
A random, unique string used for authentication.
Verifies the client is authorized to access the API.
Acts like a password for the API.
Example: "xyz789_secureKey"

Metadata/Scope Information (Optional):
Includes additional information such as:
Permissions or scopes: Defines what the API key can access (e.g., read-only, write).
Rate limits: Specifies how many requests the key can make.
Example: "scope=read-write&rate_limit=1000"
